<h1 align="center">The METAL GEAR GAUNTLET</h1>
[Milestone Project](TODO: Link when deployed)



(Work in progress)


This project is inspired by my love and enjoyment of the [Metal GearÂ®](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear) series.

The Metal Gear Gauntlet is a website is for fans of the series, or anyone else who needs a 15 minute break from whatever they are focusing on. In the [PLAY](Link to Play) Section, the user will have to run the through a gauntlet of Javascript browser games, to try and claim the top score!
The current live leaderboard can be found here: [Leaderboard](link to leaderboard)
